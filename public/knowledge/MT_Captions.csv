"Curiosity is the driver for a lot of my explorations in Midjourney. It’s a journey directed by a feeling or a hunch. In this specific instance I had a vision deep down and was  able to extract this vision through trial and error. In the end you just know you have arrived at your destination.

I don’t know if these imaginary sculptures exploring the intersection between straight edged, fragile glass, rock formations and stones make you feel anything, but to me there’s tension, beauty and something intangible aesthetic that is rooted in, and came from me/us.

"«All mystics speak the same language for they come from the same country»

This quote by Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin could be an indication of the way our relationship with religions & spirituality will develop in the future. If nirvana is to the Buddhists, what moksha is to the Hindus, what Jesus calls ‘entering the kingdom of heaven within,’ what the Sufis call the union with the Beloved, and the Jewish mystics the return to the Promised Land, then perhaps we could all share a space where we connect to something larger than ourselves, whatever we consider that to be?

What would these spaces look like in the future? What would a space need in order to facilitate this?

Sometimes the naive ideas are the best, but the hardest to accept.

"The prevailing trend in contemporary architecture often neglects the human element in our shared and private spaces, opting instead for a utilitarian approach that transforms commercial and residential buildings into mere shells of functionality. In this aesthetic, people become nothing more than transient splashes of colour against the sterile backdrops of white, grey, and impersonal coldness. This paradigm shift has gradually led to the erosion of the intricate forms, ornaments, and vibrant hues that were hallmarks of architectural design in bygone eras. How might we escape this pattern and once again prioritise form in the architectural designs of the future? 

Granted, the designs in the following slides emphasise form over function, but their value is in their power to inspire and nudge us in the direction of livelier spaces that bring back aspects of architecture that truly elevate the human spirit instead of suppressing their existence.

"Most of us aren't conscious about how colours affect us, but the truth is our psychology and biology is wired to respond to colours in specific ways. 

This imaginary installation explores the depth and mysteries of blue. A space where visitors can feel the effects of a color on their body.

From a nighttime sky to a deep blue sea, the colour blue expands out horizons and blankets our dreams. Blue lowers blood pressure and slows down heart rate, thus making the body more relaxed and under less stress. Scientists have also found that blue light can in the right conditions help treat a number of health problems.

"Whenever I embark on a new creative endevour i start by looking within. The first keys i play, or the first images i produce, are always guided by an initial feeling. 

My measure of success is all about whether I am able to accurately capture this initial feeling in the final work.

Sometimes the work evolves into something else. I wont stand in its way. 

When this happens I look within once again to see if it resonates on a deeper level. If it does not, I put the work away to rediscover some other day.

These slides contain some of the initial feelings & intuitions HEKA is built upon.

Apart from the images on the last slide, none of these visuals are mine.

"The HEKA chamber has been open for two weeks, and the response has been overwhelming, to say the least 💙

We have succeeded in creating an immersive & interactive space where people can shed their armor, become childlike, wide-eyed, open and absolutely present in the moment. The soft textures and the organic shapes of the chamber paired with Andreas Ihlebæk’s captivating music and Steven Mark Kübler’s mesmerising visuals, come together to create an experience that feels like real life magic.

Due to the success we have been asked to extend our stay at Ta∂ Galleri for an additional two weeks! New, additional show dates will come soon. 💫

Tickets available at HEKA(dot)ART now.

"You are invited to a one-night-only sensory breathwork journey in a chamber that dances with sound.

Breathwork and classical music thrive in synergy. Together, they can bring a sense of calm and tranquility while guiding our consciousness to unexplored landscapes within us. Let the rhythm of the breath and the melodies guide your awareness to bodily presence, unlocking sensory and emotional experiences.

Classical pianist Andreas Ihlebæk will play piano pieces specifically composed for the HEKA chamber, a concept by Marius Troy, and accompany the breathwork guidance of Fredrik Fernando Austad. 

The class lasts for about one hour. 

HEKA Breath
When: Tuesday 21sth of January from 18-19.30

"Music is central to the human experience—some researchers even suggest it predates spoken language. Naturally, the musical aspect of HEKA is profoundly significant.

Pianist and composer Andreas Ihlebæk has been described by Apple Music as “one of the most dynamic and boundary-breaking composers in modern classical music.” To me, his work resonates on a deeper level, reaching something primal and rooted. His latest project, RO, in which he has toured Norwegian churches and prisons to offer sacred musical experiences that help people calm their minds and reconnect, is a testament to his unique gift for serving the universe in an authentic and beautiful way.

We are incredibly fortunate to have him create the auditory vessel for your journey inside the HEKA Chamber. No one else could have done it justice.","• Music is central to the human experience—some researchers even suggest it predates spoken language.

"One of the most beautiful aspects of HEKA is the collaboration across disciplines, with incredible artists creating their best work, realizing one shared vision. 

I knew from the beginning of this project that the visual and interactive element of HEKA was crucial to get right in order to bring the audience on a deeper journey. The visuals of HEKA needed to be living and reacting to its environment. It needed to dance and be in conversation with the music and the space. 

Having been a big fan of Steven Mark Kübler’s (@perspek.steven) work for a while, I reached out and shared my vision of HEKA with him last summer. Luckily, he aligned with the vision and was up for the challenge of helping us create a fully immersive and interactive experience. 

I am proud to have Steven on as a collaborating artist on HEKA, and I cannot wait for people to experience his work and what we have created together.

This video is one of his previous works.","• One of the most beautiful aspects of HEKA is the collaboration across disciplines, with incredible artists creating their best work, realizing one shared vision.

"It is only a matter of weeks before we open the HEKA Chamber for the very first time and let people inside to experience what we have built. The vision is becoming real in a grand way, and while the world is a whirlwind I feel like I am right here in the eye of the storm. Calm. Awake. Completely surrendered to the process and the currents of the universe.

It took the universe 13.9 billion years to arrange things for us to get to this exact moment. For us to get together and create HEKA. Knowing this, I have total trust in what we are doing. 

The universe is music, and we are here to play our parts in the cosmic symphony. HEKA is not about impressing anyone. It is all about blessing people with a moment of resonance through the vibrations of musical notes, and a corresponding visual journey in a space that allows for uninterrupted connection with the present moment. 

I can’t wait to share it with you.","• It is only a matter of weeks before we open the HEKA Chamber for the very first time and let people inside to experience what we have built.
