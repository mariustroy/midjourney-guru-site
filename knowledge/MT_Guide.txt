Getting Started
With Midjourney
1
Getting started with Midjourney can seem like a 
daunting task, but if complete these simple steps you’ll 
be through the door in no time. Here’s how to get started:
HE Go to Midjourney.com and click Join the Beta.
- Create a Discord Account. You will need this to interact with 
Midjourney. Discord can be overwhelming at first, but trust me, it will 
get better.
- Once you are logged into Midjourney’s Discord server either through 
your browser or the Discord App (Desktop or Mobile), navigate to one 
of the #Newbie-rooms channels. Until you sign up for a paid 
subscription this is where you will interact with Midjourney. These 
open channels seem like motorways packed with traffic, and they can 
be pretty off-putting at first. However, one of the positive aspects of 
these open channels is that you get to watch and learn how others 
are writing prompts and using Midjourney to their benefit. That said, 
once you have a subscription you will have your own dedicated 
Midjourney Bot to interact with in private, and that is a calmer 
interface to interact with.
- Now that you’re in, take a minute to read the quick start guide where 
you’ll learn the basics of using Midjourney. You will need to 
understand the basics in order to get the most out of this guide.

What are 
Prompts and 
How are they 
Structured

Your prompt can be just a single word, a simple phrase, or even an emoji, 
but in our case we need a bit more meat to the bone in order to generate 
realistic imagery. Here is the structure of the prompts we will use:
As you can see, our prompts generally consist of three parts: (1) one or 
more reference images, (2) a text description of what to imagine, and (3) 
parameters. Parameters are basically options or settings, if you like. More 
on parameters here.

A prompt is a short text phrase that 
the Midjourney Bot interprets to 
produce images. Once a prompt is 
sent, your words and phrases are 
broken down into smaller pieces, 
called Tokens that make out the 
building blocks of the images 
generated.

Adjusting your 
settings

Before we get started with creating 
images we need to ensure we’ve 
selected the correct Midjourney 
settings. For our work there really are 
just one tweak we need to make, but I 
do recommend reading Midjourney’s 
Settings Guide so that you have a 
thorough understanding of the 
different options.
HR To bring up your Midjourney settings write /settings in the 
Discord Message box and hit enter.
yR Select MJ version 5 or higher. 
. This is 
because I have found v5+ to be more geared towards photo realism 
than v4 or lower. We discuss and compare versions later in the guide 
here.
Most of the imagery in this guide has 
been generated using Midjourney version 5 or higher
That’s it! We’re good to go!


Setting the 
Scene


In most cases text prompts include these 
fundamental building blocks:
- Type
- Subject
- Acting
- Style
- Time of day
- Place/Environment

What is in the foreground/in focus. In our case, one or more models.
Usually referred to in prompt as model, female, woman, girl, male, man, boy, group 
of three males, etc.
What the subject is doing/feeling/emoting.
Is he holding something, looking at something? 
When it comes to emotions you could be more general and write happy or sad, or 
you could choose to be more specific and write smiling or crying.  
What the subject in the photo is wearing, but also features such as ethnicity, eye 
color etc.
How much room for creativity to leave Midjourney with is up to you, but in regards 
to fashion you can refer to certain epochs, styles, films and even ask Midjourney to 
mix styles. Sometimes you have something very specific you’d like the subject to 
wear and that’s where reference images come to our rescue. 
Where the photo is taken, the scenery, location or environment.
Self explanatory, but this information is sometimes also used to 
get the type of light that we’re after.
Before we start generating images, 
we need a basic understanding of the 
text prompt. The text prompt is used 
to create the scene we would like the 
Midjourney Bot to imagine. If we have 
something very specific in mind, it’s 
obviously important that we are very 
specific in our description of this 
scene. For the best results, stay 
precise and be economical with your 
words.

Each text prompt include what I call 
building blocks. These blocks are 
used to build a scene. 


The building blocks (Subject, Time of day, Place, Style, Action) become an image:

"A wooden modernist house with linen draper hanging out of the window in the wind"

This image was generated using just the prompt above. One could experiment 
removing prepositions, but I have found that Midjourney is sometimes more 
precise when I use them.


The building blocks (Subject, Time of day, Place, Style, Action) become an image:

"A wooden modernist house covered by linen drapes on the French Riviera at dusk."

Notice how Midjourney reacts to the slight changes in wording the text prompt.


The building blocks (Type, Subject, Time of day, Place, Style, Action) become an image:
"A wooden modernist house covered by blue linen drapes on the French Riviera at dusk."

The building blocks (Type, Subject, Time of day, Place, Style, Action) become an image:
"Woman holding a camera wearing a white dress inspired by the 70s on the French Riviera in the afternoon"

The building blocks (Type, Subject, Time of day, Place, Style, Action) become an image:
"Man wearing a suit looking out over tokyo from the top of a skyscraper in the morning."

The building blocks (Type, Subject, Time of day, Place, Style, Action) become an image:
"A manga style illustration of a man wearing a suit looking out over tokyo from the top of a skyscraper in the morning."


Notice how I’ve directed MIdjourney by setting the type (illustration) of output 
and the style (manga) of that type. In my experience Midjourney is quite good at 
recognizing references to type of creative work and the different terminology 
ans styles of major creative disciplines. 
The building blocks become an image.

The building blocks (Type, Subject, Time of day, Place, Style, Action) become an image:
"An impressionist painting of a woman wearing a white dress under the night sky."

Again, notice how my description of type of medium and style affected the 
output. 

The building blocks (Type, Subject, Time of day, Place, Style, Action) become an image:
"Blue illuminated glass sculptures on a swiss mountain at sunset during winter."


Anything is possible with great text prompts, but so far we’re only scratching 
the surface of Midjourney’s capabilities....


Understanding
Midjourney’s 
Quirks
Before we fully embark on our journey 
with this AI tool, it is probably helpful 
to address some of Midjourney’s 
quirks head on.

It is important to remember that you 
are interacting with a machine, and 
the machine will at times misinterpret 
your words and ideas. 
Three mighty rules for interacting 
with the Midjourney BotT

 No unnecessary words in your 
prompts

Midjourney 
might not deliver exactly what 
you envisioned on first try, but 
it might hand you something 
unexpectedly great. You must 
be comfortable with handing 
over some of the control to the 
Midjourney Bot?

 Adjust your text, 
change your reference image, 
or settings, and then try again.
Try to be as precise as 
humanly possible.
Stay open minded. 
Try again.


Photography in 
Midjourney

If you are looking to generate photo 
realistic images it helps having some 
basic knowledge of photography 
settings & equipment as much like 
real photography, a Midjourney 
generated photograph is a result of 
the equipment it was ‘captured on’.

Being very specific about how a scene 
was captured can help produce the 
type of realism and/or style you are 
after.

There are multiple tools we can utilise 
to generate realistic photographs, 
however, I will focus on these specific 
tools: films stock, the lens, aperture, 
lighting & angle/position.


COLOR FILMS
B&W FILMS
An effective tool is telling Midjourney what film 
stock you’d like the image to be shot on. It will 
not necessarily render film-like images, but it 
will let the Midjourney Bot know that this is a 
photograph, and it might tilt your images 
towards a style you like. Here are some great 
35mm films that are frequently used in fashion 
photography:
If you are using reference images in your 
prompts, they will (usually) interfere with 
your equipment settings, so make sure you 
use images that don’t contradict your 
settings/desired outcome too much,

There are obviously a lot of different film 
stocks out there, so do your own 
research to find the look you are after.

6.1 Film Stocks


We need to let the Midjourney Bot know what 
lens the photo was shot with. You could actually 
mention the specific lens, as Midjourney does 
seem to have extensive knowledge of a wide 
range of different lenses. However, I have found 
that it’s usually enough to just specify the focal 
length. 

For those that are new to photography a lower 
number such as 12mm to 18mm have a wider 
angle of view and show more of a scene (good 
for landscapes, architecture, etc), while a higher 
number, anything from 50mm to 85mm, have a 
narrower angle of view and would be a great fit 
for something like portraits where only the 
subject should be in frame. 

The Lens
Lenses
8mm Fisheye
10-16mm Ultra wide
16-24mm Wide Angle
35-50mm Standard
55-135mm Portrait
135-300mm+ Telephoto

Macro lenses for close-up shots can 
range from 35mm to 200mm. If you want 
to render close-up shots of a subject this 
should be specified in the text prompt.
16mm
135mm
35mm
55mm
Using more general terms like ‘fisheye lens’, 
‘wide angle lens’, ‘Vintage lens’, ‘Pinhole lens’ 
also seem to work as an alternative to using 
specific focal length. 


Aperture affects the depth of field: larger 
openings create a shallower depth of field, 
while smaller openings make more of the image 
in focus. However the numbers are a bit 
counterintuitive, because the larger the number, 
the smaller the opening.

For example, f/2.8 allows twice as much light 
into the camera as f4, and 16 times as much 
light as f11. You don’t really need to understand 
the technicalities of this.
6.3 Aperture
Aperture Settings
f/1.8 (Portraits, Low Light, Shallow Depth of Field)
f/2.8 (Portraits, Low Light, Shallow Depth of Field)
f/4 (Mid-day, Some background blurring)
f/5.6 (Mid-day, Some background blurring)
f/8 (Versatile, Almost entire image in focus)
f/12 (Landscapes, Daytime, Entire image in focus)
f/16 (Landscapes, Daytime, Entire image in focus)
f/1.8
f/4
f/12
Combining aperture with the right type of 
lens makes it easier to get the results you’re 
after.



For anyone working in photography, this is really 
a crucial part of stylizing your images. 
Midjourney offers endless opportunities when it 
comes to lighting, but you might want dumb 
down your terminology a bit and be creative in 
how you make the Midjourney Bot do what you 
want it to do. 

Personally, I am a sucker for natural lighting, but 
there are different types of natural light, so 
specifying time of day or weather usually helps 
me get the results I’m after. I have found that it’s 
not necessary to mention reflectors as 
Midjourney does a great job lighting shadows. If 
you’d like more contrast you can of course 
specify darker shadows.

The subject of professional studio lighting is so 
vast that professional photographers spend 
years studying it before they feel that they have 
mastered it. I won’t elaborate on the different 
lighting techniques that exist, but I can say that I 
have found that Midjourney does understand 
some of the terminology, but not all.

I advise you to experiment with the wording of 
your settings if you’re not getting the desired 
results right away, and really, having great 
Reference Images of the type of lighting your 
after is a life saver here.

Also, specifying where the light is coming from 
is at times very useful.

Using simpler terms (ie. ‘Contrasty Lighting’) 
seem to work better than famous lighting 
techniques for now. For instance, Butterfly 
Lighting renders images with butterflies in them.

Composition, 
Framing & Angle
Achieving specific compositions isn’t always 
easy with Midjourney, but it’s in most cases 
possible to set the framing and angle of the 
camera. As with anything, you need to be 
precise with your text prompts and try your best 
not to confuse the machine. For example, 
asking for a close-up portrait of someone 
standing in a field, will most likely not render a 
close-up portrait as the word ‘standing’ will 
confuse the Midjourney Bot. So keep it to the 
bone.
TERMS FOR ANGLES & FRAMING

Low angle
High Angle

I usually mention the angle/frame as the first 
piece of my text prompt: ‘close-up of woman 
looking into camera’

Experimenting with different lenses might 
also help you get the framing you want. But 
as with anything in Midjourney; trial and 
error.

Photography Cheat Sheet

The Power of 
Reference 
Images

I have mentioned reference images 
quite a few times up until this point, 
and there’s a good reason for that. At 
times it can be difficult to direct 
Midjourney with just text, and this is 
where reference images come to the 
rescue.

If there is a specific lighting that you’d 
like in your photos, a dramatic scenery 
or perhaps a specific styling you’d like 
to include, then adding reference 
images that show Midjourney what 
you’re after can be a very powerful 
trick. I use it all the time.

See how to add reference images 
here.

Things you should know
g Reference images can be very 
powerful, so they have a 
tendency to overshadow text 
prompts. 

 by setting the image 
weight parameter. 
Make sure that the 
reference image is as 
consistent with the overall 
look you’re going for as 
possible
You can adjust the weight in 
which Midjourney considers 
the content of a reference 
image
Have a look at the prompts and 
reference images in the Book of 
Formulas to get an idea of how to 
use reference images.



7.1 With and Without 
Reference Images
In this example I have generated images using 
the exact same text prompt with and without a 
reference image. Although the image generated 
without a reference image is beautiful, the 
location and color is much more in tune with 
what I was looking for in the image with 
Reference Image.
The Reference Image
Without the Reference Image
With Reference Image

I’m rarely happy with the first images generated by Midjourney when 
I’m exploring a new idea. I use the first few attempts to perfect the 
prompt, and then, if I see hints of something that’s closer to what I 
am looking for, I use the Style Tuner or Vary functions to pursue 
and perfect my concepts. On the next few pages I’ll show my 
process for exploration and perfecting images.
Expand on 
your ideas
Also, it is good idea to read about 
asking for more versions in 
Midjourney’s own guide.


Explore with the 
Midjourney Style 
Tuner
The new Midjourney Style Tuner is 
great tool for exploring several 
directions, and is potentially a major 
time saver.

As using the tuner will requires 
you to spend a significant amount 
of your GPU credits, I suggest fine 
tuning your prompt before using the 
feature. Once you have a prompt 
you’d like to use type /tune in 
discord and enter your prompt. 

Midjourney Bot will then ask you to 
confirm, select amount of Style 
Directions and which mode you’d 
like to use. Selecting a higher 
amount of directions will give you 
more to choose from, but it will also 
eat away at your GPU credits. 
When you select a style by clicking 
on a 4-image-grid or image (in grid 
view), the Style Tuner will generate 
a prompt with a unique style code 
at the bottom of the page. You can 
copy this code and paste it as your 
next Midjourney prompt to 
generate images resembling that 
style. You won’t get the exact same 
images as presented in the tuner, 
but you can clearly tell they are 
related.

You can also select more than one 
style suggestion, combining the 
ideas you like. I have found this to 
water down the aesthetics a bit, but 
there are definitely use cases where 
this would be valuable. 

Once you have a style code you can 
use this to explore other ideas with 
that same aesthetic, or you can 
share the tuner page or your unique 
style code(s) with others. 
Unless you normally use Raw-
mode, I suggest staying in Default. 
The Raw-mode is supposedly 
instructing the Midhjourney engine 
to be less opinionated, but most of 
the time I don’t really find there to 
be much of a difference. 

Once the tuner is ready you get 
message from Midjourney Bot 
telling you the ‘Style Tuner is Ready’ 
with a link to a page listing the style 
directions. 

You can either compare two-and-
two styles at a time, or pick your 
favorites from a large grid. I prefer 
the first view option as you can only 
see one out of the four images per 
style in the grid view.



When you select a style by clicking 
on a 4-image-grid or image (in grid 
view), the Style Tuner will generate 
a prompt with a unique style code 
at the bottom of the page. You can 
copy this code and paste it as your 
next Midjourney prompt to 
generate images resembling that 
style. You won’t get the exact same 
images as presented in the tuner, 
but you can clearly tell they are 
related.

You can also select more than one

Once you have a style code you can 
use this to explore other ideas with 
that same aesthetic, or you can 
share the tuner page or your unique 
style code(s) with others. 
On the right is a series of styles 
listed from a single prompt to 
illustrate the spread in visual 
directions offered by the Style 
Tuner.
The spread in visual directions 
is often determined by the 
nature of your prompt; the more 
specific you are with your words 
and reference images, the less 
room for aesthetic exploration 
for the Style Tuner. and the 
more generic you are the more 
the styles offered will differ 
from each other.
Btw!

Using Remix 
mode to better 
control variations
Turning on Remix mode in your MIdjourney 
settings will allow you more control when 
exploring ideas in Midjourney. It allows you to 
edit your prompt for each time you generate 
new variations of previously generated images. 

Type /prefer remix to enable Remix mode, or 
open your /settings and toggle it on from there. 

In the examples to the right I’ve used Vary 
Subtle and edited my prompt.

Explore & 
Expand on your 
ideas with Vary
After upscaling an image Midjourney provides 
you with tw options to generate new variations 
of that image; Vary (Strong) and Vary (Subtle).

The Strong option is great to use when you’d 
like to generate a new set of different images 
within the same concept as the initial image. 
The Subtle option is great for the situations 
when you have an image you are quite happy 
with, but you would just like to change minor 
details.
Initial Image

I use the vary buttons quite frequently when 
exploring ideas to see if Midjourney can take my 
ideas in new unexpected directions.
Vary (Subtle)
Vary (Strong)

Inpainting with 
Vary Region
This is in my opinion the most useful 
functionality offered by Midjourney. It has 
revolutionized they way I work in Midjourney as 
it has allowed for way more control in the work 
process. 

In the examples to the right I have singled out 
the areas I’d like to change in my image, and 
then added a prompt describing the change to 
Midjourney. 

Initial Image
By marking the area I’d like to change and describing the change 
in the prompt I was able to transform the crystal sculpture into a 
luxury perfume bottle. 

The possibilities are endless with this feature. You can change 
backgrounds, clothing on subjects, remove things you don’t like 
and much much more. On the next pages I’ll show a few 
examples of how useful this feature can be. 
In order to add a text prompt when using 
Vary Region you need to have Remix mode 
enabled. Turn on by typing /prefer Remix.
Btw!

8.4.1 Vary Region:

too feel complete. Vary Region is great for 
supplying generated images with that little 
extra.

8.4.2 Vary Region:

Other times you just need to remove something

8.4.3 Vary Region: 
Changing Outfit
And sometimes you need to change the outfit 
of a subject in your image to enhance the 
composition. 
In order to select the outfit I’d like to switch I 
used the lasso tool to mark it.

Using Zoom & 
Pan to paint a 
bigger picture
When generating images Midjourney provides 
two options to expand the frame with Zoom Out 
and the arrow buttons for Panning. These 
options are great ways to paint a bigger picture 
once you have something you like. Clicking the 
Custom Zoom also provides you the option 
adjust the zoom amount and the prompt, 
handing you control over what it generates 
when expanding the frame. Zooming out 2x is 
the maximum amount per time. 

The Panning feature let’s you generate images 
of higher resolution than the initial image, 
adding pixels rather than restricting the 
resolution.

Configure the 
output with 
Parameters

The last piece of your prompt is a list 
of Parameters. We use parameters to 
configure options such as the aspect 
ratio of our images, exclude certain 
objects from our images, and what 
version of Midjourney we would like to 
use.

A full list of Midjourney’s parameters 
can be found here. 

On the following pages I will go 
through some of the most useful 
parameters for maximum creative 
control.


--ar 4:5
--ar 9:16
9.1 Aspect Ratio
--ar sets the Aspect ratio of your 
images, ie. ‘--ar 3:4’ sets an aspect 
ratio of 3:4.

1st iteration
with ‘--no balcony’ parameter
9.2 Negative 
Prompting 
--no excludes things from your 
images, ie. ‘--no balcony’ prevents 
Midjourney from generating images 
that include balconies.


--iw 2
My Reference Image
--iw .5
9.3  Image Weight
You can use --iw to tilt the weight 
between a Reference Image and 
your text prompt. In Midjourney 
version 5 the --iw values range from 
.5 to 2, where a higher value means 
the reference images have a higher 
impact on the results. Default value 
is 1. 
Here you can really see the impact of the 
reference image. The images to the right 
gives you hints of where the Midjourney 
engine wants to take the concept, while the 
images to the right are fully developed 
concepts.


--quality .25
--quality 2
9.4 Render Quality
--quality determines the time spent 
rendering your image, meaning 
you’ll get a more detailed image by 
setting a higher value, but you will 
also spend more of your GPU hours. 
You can use values between .25 
and 2.   
1 is default. I usually don’t use this 
parameter at all until I have a 
something I would like to spend the 
render time on, and render time 
cost money. 
As you can see it’s quite the difference. I 
don’t recommend going below 1 for any 
ideas that include humans.


--c 0
--c 100
9.5 Chaos
--chaos or --c determines how 
varied your results will be when 
Midjourney presents its four-image 
grid. Higher values will produce 
more varied and ‘wild’ results. A 
lower value is more conservative. 
The values range is 0 to 100, where 
0 is the default value.
These images are generated using identical 
prompts, and as you can se, a high chaos 
value renders quite a wide spread of ideas. 
This can be great for initial brainstorming 
and finding an initial direction.


--s 0
--s 100
--s 250
--s 500
9.6 Stylize
--stylize or --s determine how 
closely the generated images will 
match your prompt. A low value is 
closer to your prompt, a higher

Version
Each version of Midjourney has its 
own personality, if you like, so I 
encourage you to alternate 
between v4, v5, v5.1 and v5.2 to find 
the aesthetic you’re after.
--v sets the version of Midjourney. 
Most images in this guide have 
been made using version 5 by 
typing ‘--v 5’. You can also set your 
settings to be v5 by default.

Character 
Consistency

There are times where you would like 
to produce a series of images using 
the same model/character. In version 
5 of Midjourney this is not a straight 
forward process, but there are steps 
you can take to get what you want.

There are generally three routes for 
this
.+ You have a photo of the model 
you’d like to use already+
+ You would like to use Midjourney 
to create the model from scratch+
+ Use a plugin to swap the face of 
teh model.

In the first route it really is as simple as 
using a clear and detailed image of 
the model you’d like to use as a 
reference image. 
The second route is quite similar, as 
you will generate images with 
Midjourney until you have a model 
you would like to use. Then you hover 
over the images created by 
Midjourney, and click the three dots 
on the right. Then click ‘Add Reaction’, 
and find the envelope emoji.

When the envelope is clicked 
Midjourney will send you a message 
with the Job ID and Seed number.

Add this seed number as a parameter 
(--seed #) to your prompts from now 
on, together with one of the previously 
generated images as a reference 
image in order to generate similar 
models. 


Common 
pitfalls

As you now know Midjourney is a 
cumbersome but powerful tool to work 
with, and although the imagery 
generated can at times take your 
breath away, there are certain things 
Midjourney really struggle to get right.

Here’s a short list of what to look out for 

Hands & Feet. Midjourney has a 
tendency to really mess up hands & 
feet. If everything looks perfect, 
make sure you take an extra look at 
the hands and feet before you use 
the image#

Noses & Eyes. Sometimes you can 
just sense that something is not 
quite right with a rendered face. 
Usually the nostrils or the fake 
looking shade in the eyes is the 
cause. 

Text. Midjourney generates text, 
but it’s always jibberish. So use 
negative prompting (‘--no text’) to 
exclude text from your generated 
images. There have been reports 
of people using Vary Region to fix 
text, but I have not been able to 
make it work#

Relative size. An image might look 
good at first glance, but pay close 
attention to the size of objects in 
relation to each other. Arms might 
be way too long, a chair way too 
small, etc.�

Cars & other vehicles. Midjourney 
doesn’t seem to understand the 
logic of vehicles, so it might render 
the weirdest looking automobiles. 
Beware.

Buildings & Structures. When 
producing images of architecture 
or any other structure, pay 
attention to the fine details. Stairs 
and railings are common culprits.

There are obviously other things as 
well, but these are the aspects I have 
encountered the most.

Upscaling your 
Midjourney 
Images

In earlier versions of Midjourney you 
could only generate images up to 
1024x1024px resolution. In the fall of 
2023 Midjourney finally released a 
new upscale feature that lets you 
upscale your images at 2x or 4x the 
original size. How does the native 
upscale feature compare to other AI 
tools that specialise in upscaling 
images and artwork for professional 
use?

In my experience, the two best 
premium tools for upscaling are 
Gigapixel AI and Photoshop. If you 
have Photoshop you can find its 
upscaler under Filter > Neural Filters 
> Super Zoom. 
And while I have been getting ok 
results scaling up my images in 
photoshop, I have always been very 
impressed with the result I’ve gotten in 
Gigapixel AI, and I still use it today, 
even after Midjourney release their its 
own upscaling feature. 

The reason for this is the amount of 
options and controls offered by 
Gigapixel AI, but also because of the 
look of feel of the images. I have 
found the scaled Midjourney images 
to be a bit too smooth (plasticky) for 
my liking, while images look more 
crisp using Gigapixel AI.

Further 
Exploration
We have now covered the tools 
and workflows needed to produce 
striking imagery. However, there 
are a few valuable features in 
Midjourney that we have not 
touched on, that still deserve the 
mention:

The /describe Command
This command is a great a tool to 
help you understand how the 
Midjourney Bot thinks and explore 
its vocabulary. The /describe 
command allows you to upload an 
image and generate four possible 
prompts based on how Midjourney 
sees that image.


The /blend Command
This command lets you upload 2-5 
images and then merges their 
looks and aesthetics into new 
images. Basically the same as 
using reference images, only a 
different interface.
Relax/Fast Modes
Theses modes are just different 
ways of asking prioritising your 
prompts for the Midjourney GPU. 
The default is Fast mode, 
meaning Midjourney will try to 
render your image instantly. 
When using Relax mode your job 
is placed in a queue to be 
processed as GPUs become 
available. The upside of Relax 
mode is that it does not cost you 
any GPU time, but the wait times 
are naturally longer than in Fast 
mode.


You have reached the end!
Congratulations on completing this guide! Hopefully, 
you’re now able to extract the powers of Midjourney 
to fuel your creativity.
